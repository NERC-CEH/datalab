# 22. Material-UI for component framework

Date: 2017-11-04

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to select a front end component framework to style the web application. The
choices available are [MaterialUI](https://material-ui-next.com/),
[SemanticUI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/introduction) and
[ReactBootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/).

## Decision

We have decided to use MaterialUI for the front end component library. Additionally, we
have chosen to use the vNext version that is still in alpha as it provides a
significantly different API and we expect it to be released prior to the end of the
project.

## Consequences

We will be able to provide a well styled application.

We may have to make regular updates to keep track of the library development.

We may experience UI bugs given it is still being developed.
