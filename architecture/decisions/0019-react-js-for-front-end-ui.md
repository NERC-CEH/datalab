# 19. React.js for front end UI

Date: 2017-11-04

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to decide which front-end web framework to use for the Datalabs application.
The choices we evaluated were [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and
[Angular](https://angular.io/).

## Decision

We have decided to use the React framework for the following reasons:

* Preferred the "batteries not included" approach of React vs the "batteries
included" approach of Angular.
* Better development tooling available for React.
* Larger community for React.
* The team had previous experience with React.

## Consequences

React is currently undergoing a ground up rewrite to be released in the near future.
The React team are aiming to provide a clear upgrade path and ensure the API remains
largely unchanged. When version 16 is released we will need to upgrade.
