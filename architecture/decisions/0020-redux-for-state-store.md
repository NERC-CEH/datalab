# 20. Redux for state store

Date: 2017-11-04

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Building a complex web application brings challenges around how to manage state. The
Redux website provides an excellent [motivation page](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/Motivation.html) that discusses the challenges in detail.

## Decision

We have decided to adopt the [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) architecture to provide a clean separation between
our views, actions and state store.

## Consequences

No foreseen consequences of this choice.
