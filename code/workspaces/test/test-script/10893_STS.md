## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose of this document
This document is the System Test Script for project 10893.
### 1.2 Scope of this document
This document the test cases to test new functionality and, where available, existing dependent regression testing for the existing system. It also provides non-functional test cases where appropriate.
### 1.3 Context of this issue
This System Test Script has been produced during the project and any subsequent changes will be documented as the project progresses.

## 2 System Test Script (Functional Testing)

System testing is carried out as part of every sprint to ensure the completed stories and updated system meets all the applicable requirements. For full details on the system testing process, please consult the project test plan.
