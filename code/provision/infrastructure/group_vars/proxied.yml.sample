# Proxied Server Ansible configuration

The real version of this file is generated by the server provisioning as it needs to know the IP address of the
bastion server. This line should be

```
ansible_ssh_common_args: '-o ProxyCommand="ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -W %h:%p -q <user>@<ip_address>"'
```
