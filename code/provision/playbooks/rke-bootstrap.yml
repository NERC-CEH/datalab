# This playbook first bootstraps the Bastion server and then the rest of the cluster
# It isn't possible to configure all at once as the internal servers are not addressable
# until the Bastion hosts file has been configured.

# The JASMIN OpenStack provided Ubuntu 16.04 base image does not have Python installed so we need to install
# before we can do anything else
