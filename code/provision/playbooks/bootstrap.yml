# This playbook first bootstraps the Bastion server and then the rest of the cluster
# It isn't possible to configure all at once as the internal servers are not addressable
# until the Bastion hosts file has been configured.

# Configure networking for the bastion to allow private servers to be
# addressed by name through the bastion.
