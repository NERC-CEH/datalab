# Single use of a project's RStudio notebook #

## Why is this warning displayed? ##
Currently, an Rstudio notebook in DataLabs does not support being opened in multiple
instances.  This warning is displayed if the notebook you are about to open may be
in use by another user.  If the notebook has been opened recently (eg within the last
8 hours) then this warning is shown.  This is important because if you proceed
to open the notebook then the current user will have their instance closed, causing
some disruption to them.

## What does this warning look like ##

Here is an example of what this warning looks like.

## What should I do? ##

If you are aware of a colleague who may be using the notebook, it would be prudent to
discuss using it with them.
