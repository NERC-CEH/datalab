# 4. Open your project

In this section you will open your project and check you have the right permissions to
continue with the tutorial.

1. Starting point: you should be logged in to DataLabs, at the projects home page, with a
project visible.
![projects page](../../img/projects-page-first-project.png "projects page")

1. Click on the Open button.  You will be taken to that project page.
![project page](../../img/project-page.png "project page")

1. Verify that your email address is listed as a project admin (like
project.admin@ceh.ac.uk is).
If you are listed as a user or a viewer, you will not have permission to create storage or
a notebook - contact one of the project admins in order to obtain the right permission.

1. On the left hand side of the page, you will see Notebooks and Storage.
We will create and use these in the remainder of the tutorial.
