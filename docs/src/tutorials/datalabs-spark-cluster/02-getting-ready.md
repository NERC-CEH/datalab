# 2. Getting ready

The Spark workers run Python in a particular environment.

You must specify a Conda environment for the Spark cluster when it is created.
This environment can be created inside a Jupyter notebook.

Before proceeding, ensure that you have:

* a project
* project storage
* a JupyterLab notebook
* a Conda environment

If you are unsure how to create these, then please follow the material in the tutorials

* [My First Notebook](../my-first-notebook/)
* [My first Jupyter project](../getting-started-jupyter/)
