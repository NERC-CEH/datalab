# Getting ready

[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) is a tool to turn data analysis
scripts into web apps.  To use it in DataLabs, you will need the
following:

* A project
* A data store
* A Conda environment
* A notebook or web IDE to edit code in the project storage (e.g JupyterLab
or Visual Studio Code)

You can see tutorials to get started at:

* [My First Notebook](../my-first-notebook/)
* [My first Jupyter project](../getting-started-jupyter/)
* [My first Visual Studio Code project](../getting-started-vscode/)
* [Conda Environments Quick-Start-Guide](../../conda-pkgs/)

You'll need to have Streamlit installed in your Conda environment, so
if you haven't already, run

```bash
conda install streamlit
```

to get it installed.
