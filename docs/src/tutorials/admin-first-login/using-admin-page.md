# Using the Admin Page

This page provides a place for admins to see high level information of what is currently
running in this instance of Datalabs.

## Accessing Resources

By default when using the admin page, all projects and resources within them are visible.
This can aid when troubleshooting issues as well as assessing the capacity of the cluster.

The search bar allows you to search for an individual project if necessary.

## Editing User Permissions

The other main function of the admin page is to edit permissions of users. From this tab you
are able to search for a user either by name or using the pre-defined filters in order to
see what resources are allocated to them. Additionally you can make them either an
`Instance Admin` (i.e give them full admin rights to manage the site), or a `Data Manager`,
which will give them access to the `Asset Repo` in order to add metadata records.

In the example below `user2@ceh.ac.uk` has been assigned the role of `Data Manager` by selecting
the corresponding box.
