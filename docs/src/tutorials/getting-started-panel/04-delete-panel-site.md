# 4. Delete Panel site

In this section you will delete a Panel site.

As sites are driven by the contents of a notebook and doesn't contain the code
itself, they can be deleted when they are no longer needed.

Starting point: you should be logged in to DataLabs, in a project you have admin
permissions for, and a Panel site should already exist.

![panel delete](../../img/project-panel-delete.png "panel delete")

Select **Confirm deletion** to delete the Panel site.
