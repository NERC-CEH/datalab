# My first RStudio Project

This tutorial is recommended for all users who are starting a new project in RStudio for the
first time.

This tutorial will walk you through setting up a basic RStudio project which crucially uses
[renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html), a tool designed to capture all
of your packages alongside the code and which is needed within DataLabs for your project to
work consistently.

1. [Create a project](create-project.md)
2. [Install some packages](install-packages.md)
3. [Run some example analysis code](example-analysis.md)
