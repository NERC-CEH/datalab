# 8. Conclusion

__Congratulations!__

In this tutorial, you have:

* Understood what Dask clusters are.
* Created a Dask cluster, utilising the same Conda environment as your notebook.
* Started the Dask client in a notebook.
* Accessed the Dask dashboard.
* Performed a Dask calculation.
* Deleted the Dask cluster.

It is also possible to access the Data Store from your Dask cluster,
just as you would from your notebook;
and to create a 'vanilla' Dask cluster, that doesn't require a pre-existing Conda environment.
