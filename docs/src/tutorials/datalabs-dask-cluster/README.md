# My first Datalabs Dask cluster

In this tutorial you will create a *Dask cluster* within Datalabs, and use it within a notebook.

A Dask cluster created this way can use the same Conda environment as your notebook,
and access your project storage.

It is recommended that you should already be familiar with the material in the tutorial
[My first Jupyter project](../getting-started-jupyter/README.md).
