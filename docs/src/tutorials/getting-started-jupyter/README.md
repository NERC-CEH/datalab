# My first Jupyter Project

This tutorial is recommended for all users who are starting a new project in Jupyter for the
first time and will go through some small example R and python code.

By the end of this tutorial you should have in place a [conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html),
some basic R and python packages, and have run example code snippets for each.

1. [Create a Conda environment](create-project.md)
2. [Install some packages](install-packages.md)
3. [Run some example analysis code](example-analysis.md)
