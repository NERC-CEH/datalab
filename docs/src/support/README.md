# Getting Help #

## I'm having trouble logging into DataLabs ##

In order to login to DataLabs you'll need to create an account using the sign up button
from the home page. Once you've created an account you'll need to verify your e-mail
before being able to sign in.

## I have signed in but can't see anything, what do I do now ##

Initially ou will only be able to see projects which you own or have been given
access to. If you are collaborating with someone else on a project, you can ask them to
add you to the relevant project. Otherwise get in touch with us on Slack about
having a project set up for you which we'll be happy to help with if you're working
on a relevant project.

## Where do I get started having logged in with access to a project ##

A number of [tutorials](../tutorials/) will be added over time which will help with
getting started within DataLabs.

## I've never used notebooks before, where can I find out more ##

A number of notebooks are available in DataLabs, links to useful introductory documentation
for each of them can be found below.

* [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/collections/rstudio-essentials/)
* [Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.6.0/quickstart/explorezeppelinui.html)

All of them share a common theme of providing a work environment where code can be run and
visualized, while also running on a platform that allows you to work collaboratively with others.

## I have noticed some things which are different about working in DataLabs than locally ##

There are a few key differences to know about working within DataLabs that it is
useful to know about

The main one is concerning how packages are installed and persisted. Within DataLabs your
runtime environment (i.e Python & R packages) must be stored alongside the code, practically
this means using tools such as [Conda environments](../tutorials/conda_environments.md)
or [Packrat](../r-libs/packrat.md).
  
## I am having problems which I can't find the answer to here, how do I get help ##

We are active on [Slack](https://nerc-datalabs.slack.com/) and happy to discuss any
problems with you there where possible.
