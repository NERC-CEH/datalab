# Admin Tutorials

These pages contain tutorials for DataLabs focused at users who will administer
the application.

The tutortials are focused on introducing you to the key functionality around
managing DataLabs. Including how to proceed after first logging in and dealing
with common requests and troubleshooting basic issues.

They take the form of clear, step-by-step instructions,
with an emphasis on *how* to achieve a relatively simple goal.
