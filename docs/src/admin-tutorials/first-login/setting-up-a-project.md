# 5. Setting Up A Project

When logging in for the first time as an admin you will likely see the following
screen as there will be no existing projects.

![initial login screen](../../img/initial-login-screen.png "initial login screen")

After selecting `Create Project` fill out the form as below, noting the following things;

* The `Name` and `Description` can be changed at a later date whereas the `Project Key` cannot.
* The `Project Key` will be used in the URL of the project and all of it's resources
  (notebooks & sites) hence it is important to pick something unique and clear.

Once you have submitted this, you should be able to browse into the project and see
information such as the current members, as well as a number of options on the sidebar
for creation of resouces as wellas administering the project. See other tutorials for
creation of resources, however importantly from this page you can add additional users
as well as change information about the project itself such as its `Name` and
`Description`.

In order to add a new user to the project, enter their e-mail address (they should have
logged in previously in order to do this) into the `Add User` box and assign them a
permission before pressing `Add`. In this case `user2@ceh.ac.uk` has been made an admin
of the project.
