# Uploading files within DataLabs

When external data cannot be accessed externally it is often required for data to be
brought into DataLabs.

For data that is available externally (for example by a direct download or API) it
is recommended that data sets are downloaded directly into the lab environment
using notebooks such as Jupyter/RStudio for purposes of ease.

This section will detail uploading data to the DataLabs storage either locally from
a PC or some other source via Minio. (Note that for small files on the order of
megabytes, these can be uploaded using Jupyter and RStudios respective 'upload'
functions which work perfectly well).
