# Using Dask within JupyterLab

Dask is a widely used library for parallel computing in Python, information
regarding it can be found [here](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/).

Within DataLabs, the JupyterLab extension [`dask-labextension`](https://github.com/dask/dask-labextension)
is installed by default, and hence can be used to deploy and use a Dask Cluster.
This will be able to take advantage of the compute resources shared within the
environment to aid in solving issues that are parallel in nature.
